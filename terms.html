    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta" style="opacity: 0.5; margin-bottom: 3rem;">Effective: February 2026</p>

    <p>These terms govern your use of the AIME Intelligence website (<strong>aimeintelligence.com</strong>) and provide general context for consulting engagements. By using this site, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>Consulting Engagements</h2>
    <p>All consulting engagements between AIME Intelligence and its clients are governed by individual <strong>Statements of Work (SOWs)</strong> executed between the parties. These SOWs define scope, deliverables, timelines, compensation, and any additional terms specific to the engagement. In the event of a conflict between these general terms and an executed SOW, the SOW prevails.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified in the applicable SOW, the <strong>client owns all deliverables</strong> produced during an engagement upon full payment. AIME Intelligence retains the right to use general knowledge, methodologies, and non-proprietary techniques developed or refined during the engagement. Pre-existing intellectual property of either party remains the property of its original owner.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>AIME Intelligence treats all client information as confidential. Specific confidentiality obligations are defined in the applicable SOW or a separate NDA. Case studies published on this site are anonymized or published with explicit client permission.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, AIME Intelligence's total liability for any claim arising from a consulting engagement shall not exceed the fees paid by the client for that engagement. AIME Intelligence shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits or data, regardless of the theory of liability.</p>

    <h2>Website Use</h2>
    <p>The content on this website is provided for informational purposes only. While we make reasonable efforts to keep it accurate, we make no warranties regarding completeness or currency. This site does not constitute professional advice.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms and any disputes arising from them are governed by the laws of the <strong>Province of Ontario, Canada</strong>. The courts of Ontario shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. The effective date at the top of this page indicates the most recent revision.</p>
